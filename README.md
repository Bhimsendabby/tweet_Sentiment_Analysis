# Twitter Sentiment Analysis with SVM and Word2Vec

## Overview

This project performs sentiment analysis on a large Twitter dataset containing over **400,000 tweets** categorized as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. The goal is to build a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model using Word Embeddings generated by the **Word2Vec Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)** model to classify the sentiments accurately.
